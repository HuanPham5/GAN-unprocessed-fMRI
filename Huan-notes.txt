Background:

Schizophrenia: a serious mental illness that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. 
People with schizophrenia may seem like they have lost touch with reality, which can be distressing for them and for their family and friends. 
The symptoms of schizophrenia can make it difficult to participate in usual, everyday activities, but effective treatments are available.


The data:

raw anatomical and functional MR data from 72 patients with Schizophrenia and 75 healthy controls (ages ranging from 18 to 65 in each group).
All subjects were screened and excluded if they had; history of neurological disorder, history of mental retardation, 
history of severe head trauma with more than 5 minutes loss of consciousness, 
history of substance abuse or dependence within the last 12 months. 
Diagnostic information was collected using the Structured Clinical Interview used for DSM Disorders (SCID).

A multi-echo MPRAGE (MEMPR) sequence was used with the following parameters:
 TR/TE/TI = 2530/[1.64, 3.5, 5.36, 7.22, 9.08]/900 ms, flip angle = 7°, 
 FOV = 256x256 mm, Slab thickness = 176 mm, Matrix = 256x256x176, Voxel size =1x1x1 mm,
Number of echos = 5, Pixel bandwidth =650 Hz, Total scan time = 6 min. 
With 5 echoes, the TR, TI and time to encode partitions for the MEMPR are similar to that of a conventional MPRAGE,
 resulting in similar GM/WM/CSF contrast.

Rest data was collected with single-shot full k-space echo-planar imaging (EPI) with ramp sampling correction using
 the intercomissural line (AC-PC) as a reference (TR: 2 s, TE: 29 ms, matrix size: 64x64, 32 slices, voxel size: 3x3x4 mm3).

Slice Acquisition Order:
Rest scan - collected in the Axial plane - series ascending - multi slice mode - interleaved
MPRAGE - collected in the Sag plane - series interleaved - multi slice mode - single shot




Past works:
1) Functional Network Connectivity (FNC)-based GAN:

This GAN architecture, consisting of a generator and a discriminator with four fully-connected layers, 
was applied for fMRI classification with the intention of diagnosing specific conditions through identifying a set of features​.

2) Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN):

WGAN was utilized to augment brain functional connectivity data from fMRI to improve classification accuracy. 
The study focused on enhancing the functional connectivity network for better classification results​.

3) BrainGAN:
The paper introduces a framework named BrainGAN for creating and categorizing brain MRI images through 
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) structures and deep learning models. 
Additionally, it offers an automated method to ensure the generated images meet a satisfactory standard. 
The framework utilizes three models: CNN, MobileNetV2, and ResNet152V2​1​.

To do list: 

1) have a subset: 30 images ready by next week

2) match id in csv with the files in 4D, that is Schizophrenia and control

should be 173 when combined from demographic csv
